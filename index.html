   <h3>Here is a project I worked on using CSS and HTML to advertise for an Island Vacation. I worked on this project with Ian Lesikar.</h3>

   <p><a href="https://github.com/NickArrasate/ResortSite.git">This link</a> will take you to the git repo.</p>

   <h3>This is a draft of a blog about dreams I wrote with Ashley Maceli. We used html and CSS.</h3>

   <p>Follow <a href="https://github.com/NickArrasate/dreamblog.git">this link</a> to visit the github repo.</p>

   <h3>On this project, Conner Cummings and I worked with Bootstrap, html, and custom CSS to try and replicate the landing page on Wikipedia.</h3>

   <p>This was our first project using bootstrap extensively and we plan on revisiting the project to get it closer to the original. We stumbled all along the way on this one but learned a lot. <a href="https://github.com/NickArrasate/wiki-replica.git">Here's the link></p>
