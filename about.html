    <h4>A little about me...</h4>
  </div>
    <p class="lead text-left">I am currently studying full time at Epicodus and plan on doing the Front End and Design track. I came here because I love seeing projects take shape and collaborating. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me after the program and for all of the thing I'll learn while I'm here.</p>

    <p class="text-left">I have been coding as a hobby for almost a year and decided I was ready to accelerate my learning and commit to it!</p>

    <p class="text-left">My passion in life has always been music. I studied at PSU and PCC while working toward a degree in Jazz Composition. I<em> try </em>to play guitar every day.</p>

    <p class="text-left">I relish every opportunity I get to teach someone or pass along any skills I've picked up along the way. Teaching someone to play an instrument is so rewarding!</p>

    <p class="text-left">Before starting Epicodus I worked for Whole Foods Market for <strong> ten years </strong>. I learned how to work on a team and how to lead one. I spent three years in a leadership role there, responsible for training people, developing and executing programs and purchasing and maintaining inventories. Before Epicodus began, I moved into a completely different position there as a carpentry and equipment maintenence tech. I'll just say I got really handy, really fast. During this time I also with a good friend of mine helping with his small business in an exploding industry. I love working with tight knit groups of people and I believe that <span id="teamwork">teamwork makes the dream work!</span></p>
